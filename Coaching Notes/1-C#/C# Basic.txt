C#
* using System-S always caps
* Main()- M always caps
* convert.toint32(console.readline()); // int
* double.todouble(console.readline()); // double
* char.tochar(console.readline());    // char
* console.readline(); //string
* if else->always space between else if
* case 1:->always space biteen case and 1
* default:->after default : this symbol not space contain
* while, do,for,->after that used if 
* console.write();-means all things in a one line
* console.writeline();->all things in downward line

---
is a high level,object oriented and type safe programming language
* c# was developed by anders heljsberg in 2002
* it is the product of microsoft
* c# is a plateform independent language
Type Safe
--------------
in c int a="hello";(type unsafe)because at a time it does not show an error 
after compilation it will show an error but in c# int a="hello";(type safe)as soon as when you
press enter it show an error
Dot Net
------------
dot net is not programming language.dot net is a framework to develop d/w kind 
of application
* dot net support multiple programming language(62+)
Type Of Application
----------------------
1-CUI(command user interface)-console based application ex-cmd
2-GUI(graphical user interface)-
1-Desktop Application
---------------------
* window based application as stand alone app.
* an application that runs with the help of o.s
* compability issue
2-Web Application
--------------------
* an application that runs with the help of web browser 
* it fallow client server architecture
* it can be access anywhere
3-Android App/Mobile
---------------------------
xamarine/mono
Asp Dot Net(active server pageg)(network enabled technology)
-------------------------------------------------------------
it is a programing language. it is used to develop web application only
Dot Net Component
------------------
their are 2 main component of dot net 
1-CLR(common language runtime)
------------------------------------
it is resonsible to run your all dot net application 
* CLR is the heart of dot net framework
Some Sub Component Of CLR
-------------------------------
1-CTS(common type system)
-----------------------------
all primitive data type ex-int,float,char,doble,bool
2-CLS(common language specification)
----------------------------------------
after compilation of your code you did not get ang d/w(msil)
3-GC(garbage collector)
---------------------------
it is responsible for automatic memory mgmt
* it release all your program memory automatically
4-Native Code
-----------------
byte code(m/c independent code)
2-BCL/FCL(base class library/framework class library)
------------------------------------------------------
it contains predifined classes,interface and method
Ex In C
-----------
#include<stdio.h>
scanf()-to take input from the user
printf()-to display the output
Ex IN C#
---------
using system; //BCL/FCL
console.readline()-to take input from the user
console.writeline()-to display the results
Compilation Process Of C#
-----------------------------
it is 2 ways compilation process
1-in first compilation process of C# compiler convert source code into MSIL code
2-in second compilation process JIT compiler convert MSIL code into native code
